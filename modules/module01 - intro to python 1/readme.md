# Module 01: Intro to Python

## Overview

In this module we will introduce the basics of Python, a powerful programming language for data analysis, visualization, and software development. It's a great starter language because its syntax is simple and straightforward. We will use Miniconda to install Python onto our computers, and we will work with Python via the Jupyter notebook. Jupyter notebooks let you use Python in an interactive coding environment that's easily packaged up and shared with others.

## Reading Materials

Please complete these readings *before class begins*.

  1. Make sure you have finished reading last week's [getting started with conda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/getting-started.html), all about [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/), and the [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io) 'getting started' and 'user guide' sections.
  1. McKinney chapters 1-3 (on blackboard > course material > textbooks).
  1. Optional: there's a lot to absorb in the first few weeks for newcomers to Python. If you need some clarification or extra practice, read through the relevant sections of Downey's Think Python. It's clear, straightforward, and tailored to absolute beginners.

## In Class
  
  1. Using git, clone (or pull if you already have it) this repo.
  1. Open a command prompt and change directory to this directory.
  1. Activate the virtual environment.
  1. Run the command: `jupyter lab`
  1. A browser window will open. Click the notebook to launch it.
