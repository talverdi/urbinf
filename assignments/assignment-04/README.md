# Assignment 4

Due Sun 3 Nov by 23:59 via Blackboard submission.

First, get your hands on a data set. You can download one as a file, connect to an API to download data, or use some data set you're working with elsewhere in life. Whatever you'd like. But perhaps consider a data set that helps you move toward the final project. You may use the same data set as in the previous assignment, but preferably choose a new one.

Create a new Jupyter notebook. Use geopandas to load your data set and clean/process it as needed.

Using the mapping techniques we learned in class, visualize interesting aspects of your data. Create at least 3 static maps and explain both the color map and the projection you chose to use (in markdown). These maps can be plotted with geopandas directly or with cartopy. Each map should be followed by a markdown cell that succinctly explains what you are visualizing and why it is interesting. Finally, create at least 1 interactive web map, either using folium, carto, or leaflet directly.

Make sure your notebook runs from the top without any errors and that all the visuals can be seen inline (without me having to re-run your notebook). Then submit your notebook, web map file, and your data file, zipped, via Blackboard.
