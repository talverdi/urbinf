# Assignment 3

Due Sun 6 Oct by 23:59 via Blackboard submission.

First, get your hands on a data set. You can download one as a file, connect to an API to download data, or use some data set you're working with elsewhere in life. Whatever you'd like. But perhaps consider a data set that helps you move toward the final project.

Create a new Jupyter notebook. Use pandas to load your data set and clean/process it as needed.

Using the matplotlib techniques we learned in class, visualize interesting aspects of your data set. Create at least 4 (in total) visualizations using at least 3 different visualization types (such as bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, or anything else). You can optionally use other Python visualization libraries like seaborn or bokeh for any visualizations beyond the minimum required. Each visualization should be followed by a markdown cell that succinctly explains what you are visualizing and why it is interesting.

Make sure your notebook runs from the top without any errors and that all the visuals can be seen inline (without me having to re-run your notebook). Then submit your notebook and your data file, zipped, via Blackboard.
