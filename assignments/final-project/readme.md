# Final Project

## Overview

The final project is a cumulative and applied assignment that requires you to use the skills you developed over the entire semester. I want you to develop an interesting research question that can be answered using the spatial analytics, modeling, and visualization methods we have learned in this course.

## Instructions

Develop a spatial research question that interests you.

Collect data from two or more different sources, including but not limited to: data APIs, web scraping, public data portals, FTP servers, or directly from an organization.

Clean, organize, merge, and process the data using pandas/geopandas into a nice analyzable format

Conduct a statistical analysis. This shall include, at a minimum, a set of descriptive statistics, some exploratory spatial analysis, and a model, such as a spatial multiple regression model.

Create 3 or more static data visualizations, such as scatter plots, bar charts, line graphs, etc. Feel free to use matplotlib or a similar visualization library.

Create 3 or more maps, including at least 1 choropleth map and 1 point map. Optionally consider creating an interactive web map.

Write a data narrative telling the story of your analysis in 2500+ words (not including tables, figures, captions, or references). Incorporate the visualizations and analytical results into your narrative. Organize it into five sections: 1, introduction (provide an overview of your entire project); 2, background (explain the context, prior work, and motivation leading to your research question). 3, methods (explain your data and your analytical process). 4, results (lay out your findings and visuals). 5, discussion (circle back to your research question and what your analysis tells you about it; what is the big picture; how are these findings useful?). At the top of the first page, include your name, the date, your project title, and the word count (not including tables, figures, captions, or references).

## Submission

**Project proposals** are due Sun 27 Oct: this is a 1 page paper explaining your project idea, the motivation, where you will acquire your data, how you will process it, and how you will visualize it. What sort of findings do you expect? What new insights will they provide? Write up as a PDF and submit via Blackboard.

**Final projects** are due Thu 12 Dec, via Blackboard submission. Please submit a zip file containing the narrative (as PDF), your visualization and map image files, web maps (if any), and the Jupyter notebook(s) and data files used to complete this project. Make sure everything is runnable and reproducible. Late final project submissions will not be accepted or graded.
